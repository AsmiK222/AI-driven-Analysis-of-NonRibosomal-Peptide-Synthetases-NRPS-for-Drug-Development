# AI-driven-Analysis-of-NonRibosomal-Peptide-Synthetases-NRPS-for-Drug-Development
Our project aims to leverage artificial intelligence to analyze complex NRPS pathways, which are responsible for producing peptide-based drugs like antibiotics and anti-cancer agents. Traditional methods for analyzing NRPS are slow, costly, and prone to errors due to the complexity and large data volume involved
